## Final Project: Network Analysis

This repository contians information and analysis of three networks and their traffic as part of our final project at the University of Denver's cybersecurity bootcamp.

### This powerpoint underlines the five main vulnerabilities found within these networks:
- Protection Mechanism Failure x3 (CWE-693)
- Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)
- Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-359)
- Unintended Proxy or Intermediary (CWE-441)
- Download of Code Without Integriy Check (CWE-494)

### Steps we can take to remediate these vulnerabilities
- Update systems to the latest versions. (Windows Defender or Apple Platform Security can warn you and stop well known viruses before they take hold.)
- Invest in an intrusion detection or prevention system. These can be part of a single WAP's provided services and are crucial for business security.
- Utilize anti-virus software and update it to the latest release. (Multiple incidents in this analysis could have been prevented by utilizing anti-virus as the exploits were well known.)
- Ensure the principle of least privilege is applied. (Device security management is crucial whether it is not giving employees access to create and add devices like an active directory or having proper account restrictions so that a compromised account doesn't have full system access.)
