Information Security repository
## Final Project: Network Analysis

This repository contians information and analysis of three networks and their traffic as part of our final project at the University of Denver's cybersecurity bootcamp.

### This powerpoint underlines the five main vulnerabilities found within these networks:
- Protection Mechanism Failure x3 (CWE-693)
- Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)
- Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-359)
- Unintended Proxy or Intermediary (CWE-441)
- Download of Code Without Integriy Check (CWE-494)

### Steps we can take to remediate these vulnerabilities
- Update systems to the latest versions. (Windows Defender or Apple Platform Security can warn you and stop well known viruses before they take hold.)
- Invest in an intrusion detection or prevention system. These can be part of a single WAP's provided services and are crucial for business security.
- Utilize anti-virus software and update it to the latest release. (Multiple incidents in this analysis could have been prevented by utilizing anti-virus as the exploits were well known.)
- Ensure the principle of least privilege is applied. (Device security management is crucial. This includes right and privileges of users ranging from ability to change or add devices to a network, like the added active directory that bypassed security, or having proper account restrictions so that a compromised account doesn't have full system access.)
